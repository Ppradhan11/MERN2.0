To see the result of app.js you need to type node app.js in terminal

Install nodemon 
 npm install nodemon
 Now, go to the package.json; bleow at script delete
 "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" and Add 
 "start" : "nodemon app.js"
 If we use other nickname rather than start the command should be => npm run xyz (run is required)

 As node app.js need to be typed every change
 nodemon is used and called by: npm start
 Now the change in file will be changed witho out calling the file in terminal again and again
If the Node Version is over 18.1, nodemon is not required.
node --watch app.js can be achieved
